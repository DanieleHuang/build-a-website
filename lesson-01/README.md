## Introductions

### Wesley Chen

Hi! My name is Wesley Chen, and I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering at UCSD. I am also minoring in Music.

Interests:

-   Computer
-   Music
-   Swimming
-   Sleep
-   Community Service

Why you should believe what I say:

-   I was also in high school two years ago

If you have any suggestions, please open a pull request on this repo and make it better ;)

## Why are you here?

The goal of this program is to give you some insight into what it's like to be a software programmer. Maybe you'll get inspired and become a CTO of some company worth billions of dollars (if so, please hook me up with a job).

You'll learn how to make your very own website, which you can put on your college resume.

Having web development skills is quite important these days as our society transitions to heavily rely on the internet. [Instagram](https://instagram.com), [Facebook](https://facebook.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com) are all websites that you probably use on a daily basis - people made those!

## Google is your friend

Any good programmer knows how to use Google. If you have a problem, you should ask the internet first. _Most_ of the time it is right. If you don't know, ask Google!

## Git

You use Google Drive to store and view documents on the cloud. Programmers use Git and Github to store and view their code on the cloud.

[This guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) is pretty good at explaining what Git is. Read it, then read my bad explanation of it.

**TODO** some simplified git explanation for high schoolers here

## Github

[Github](https://github.com) is a website that helps us developers store and manage our code. [Google search results](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+github) can give us more insight into what Github is. Some features that Github have make it really easy for us to do cool things, like [contribute without knowing command line](https://desktop.github.com/) or [have our own website hosted online for free](https://pages.github.com/)!

## Github Desktop

Next time, we will explore what [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) is and how we will use it.

## Task: Make a Github account!

One of the first steps of being a legit programmer is making a Github account.

Steps:
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com).

2.  Sign up for an account.
3.  Think about your username! It will probably stay with you forever, and companies will see it when they are hiring you.
4.  Follow the instructions of this [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
5.  Congratulations! You've made your first repository!

**TODO** show some screenshots of how to make a github account
