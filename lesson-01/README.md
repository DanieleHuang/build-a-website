### Wesley Chen

Hi! My name is Wesley Chen, and I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering at UCSD. I am also minoring in Music.

    _ Community Service
    _ Dota 2 (autochess is fun), brawl stars sometimes

If you have any suggestions, please open a pull request on this repo and make it better ;)

## Why are you here?

The goal of this program is to give you some insight into what it's like to be a software programmer. Maybe you'll get inspired and become a CTO of some company worth billions of dollars (if so, please hook me up with a job).

You'll learn how to make your very own website, which you can put on your college resume.

Having web development skills is quite important these days as our society transitions to heavily rely on the internet. [Instagram](instagram.com), [Facebook](facebook.com), [Twitter](twitter.com) are all website that you probably use on a daily basis - people made those!

## Git

> if you are a programmer, you should know what git is.
