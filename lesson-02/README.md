## Github Desktop

### Normal Git commands

Normally, to use Git and Github, we would need to use the _terminal_ on our computers to save our code in the cloud. Here's what it looks like:

Initializing a repository

```bash
git init
```

Cloning a repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wes-chen/build-a-website.git
```

Pulling the most recent changes from your repository

```bash
git pull
```

Committing some changes in your local machine

```bash
git commit
```

Pushing your changes to the **internet** (Github)

```bash
git push origin [branch-name]
```

### Github Desktop to the rescue!

Fortunately, you don't have to learn this terminal stuff until you get to college.

Github Desktop makes it easy for us to do all of these operations with the click of a few buttons!

Let's try to pull our repository from last week, edit some files, commit our changes, then push it back to Github!

If you weren't here last week, no worries! [Here](https://github.com/wes-chen/build-a-website/tree/master/lesson-01) is last week's lesson. Please [create a Github account](https://github.com/join) and follow [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to make your very first repository!

1.  Sign in to Github Desktop

2.  Clone your repository from the cloud.

## Github Pages

Github has a cool feature where you can host your own website! All you need to do is create a repository named [your username here].github.io and it'll automatically host your website at [your username].github.io. Isn't that cool?

TODO add info about Github Pages
