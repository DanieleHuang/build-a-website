### What is Github Desktop?

Normally, to use Git and Github, we would need to use the _terminal_ on our computers to `pull`, `commit`, and `push` our code. Here's what it looks like:

Initializing a repository

```bash
git init
```

Cloning a repository
`git clone https://github.com/wes-chen/build-a-website.git`

Pulling the most recent changes from your repository
`git pull`
